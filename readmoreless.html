<h2>Example TEXT</h2>
<p>Mine eye hath play'd the painter and hath stell'd
Thy beauty's form in table of my heart;
My body is the fr<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">ame wherein 'tis held,
And perspective it is the painter's art.
For through the painter must you see his skill, 5
To find where your true image pictured lies;
Which in my bosom's shop is hanging still,
That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes.
Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done:
Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me
Are windows to my breast, where-through the sun
Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;
Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art;
They draw but what they see, know not the heart.
